# About Me
Hi, I'm Maia üëãüèª I started dancing in my freshman year at Williams College, and started calling shortly thereafter, because the student contra group needed callers and I was already a bit of ham, so why not stand in front of a mic and tell people what to do?! I was hooked on both dancing and calling, and I've been doing both ever since!

Other hats I wear, in case you're curious:

<ul class="narrow-top">
	<li>
		I conduct the <a href="https://www.chamberchoirs.nyc/welcome" target="_blank">New York Chamber Choir</a> (go have a listen!)
	</li>
	<li>
		I dabble in <a href="https://crosswords.maiamccormick.com" target="_blank">constructing crossword puzzles</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		I make my living <a href="https://code.maiamccormick.com" target="_blank">as a programmer</a>
	</li>
</ul>

* "Maia McCormick was incredible. She handled the topic of role swapping with grace and encouragement. I had such a fun time!" (Balance the Bay 2024 attendee)
* "I've noticed that you only tell a joke or an anecdote when it's relevant or when you need to kill some time, and I appreciate that - it makes for a very tight-feeling evening where I feel like we danced as much as we could." (Boston-area dancer)
