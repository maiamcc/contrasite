This page contains a handful of resources on gender-free folk dancing, and in particular on the terms Larks/Ravens, which are gaining traction throughout the contra world. It's certainly not meant to be the definitive internet home of Larks/Ravens; it _is_, however, a collection of links and resources that I hope some people find useful!

In particular, we're using this page for notes from our NEFFA 2019 session: *Bird Talk: Why Larks and Ravens?* We recorded our panel: [check out the video](https://www.facebook.com/events/266947124256977/permalink/270805077204515/), and stay tuned for an audio recording (hopefully of better quality).

Got a resource that you think should be listed here? [Contact me](/contact.html).

#### Trans\* Resources
A lot of the conversation about de-gendering contra centers on the experience of transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming folks (often referred to by the umbrella term "trans\*"). If you or someone you know needs a primer on these different labels, what it means to be trans*, and the specific challenges facing these groups, start here.
