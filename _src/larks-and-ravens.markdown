This page contains a handful of resources on gender-free folk dancing, and in particular on the terms Larks/Ravens, which are gaining traction throughout the contra world. It's certainly not meant to be the definitive internet home of Larks/Ravens; it _is_, however, a collection of links and resources that I hope some people find useful!

In particular, we're using this page for notes from our upcoming NEFFA session: *Bird Talk: Why Larks and Ravens?* Join us this Saturday at 11AM, or [tune into our livestream](https://www.facebook.com/events/266947124256977) or watch the session afterwards.
