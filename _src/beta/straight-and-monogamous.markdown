	      <p><strong>A1</strong>: circle L 3/4 and pass through up/down</p>
              <p>1s do a half figure-eight down through the 2s (all end proper)</p>
	      <p><strong>A2</strong>: circle R 3/4<p>
              <p>mad robin around P (lark #1/raven #2 in front first) and lark #1/raven #2 cross set by R shoulder</p>
	      <p><strong>B1</strong>: same role L shoulder walk-around 1 1/4<p>
	      <p>left hand star 3/4 (until you're on the side with your partner)</p>
              <p><strong>B2</strong>: whoever's in front loop back over R shoulder for P meltdown swing</p>
      </span>
      <p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: <span class="dance-notes">Oodles of same-role flirting opportunities! Star in B1 is initiated by #1 raven & #2 lark (who should both be looking at P's back).<span></em></p>
