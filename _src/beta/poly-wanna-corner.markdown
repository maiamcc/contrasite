	      <p><strong>A1</strong>: N balance and swing (end facing down)</p>
	      <p><strong>A2</strong>: down the hall four in line, right side turn as couple/left side turn alone (puts the ravens in the middle)</p>
              <p>come back, [ larks / ravens ] gate their neighbor up
	      <p><strong>B1</strong>: [ ravens / larks ] turn same role contra-corners</p>
	      <p><strong>B2</strong>: same role balance and swing</p>
              <p><strong>C1</strong>: (roll out of swing for) partner balance and swing</p>
              <p><strong>C2</strong>: ravens chain across</p>
              <p>left hand star 1x to new N's</p>
      </span>
      <p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: <span class="dance-notes">Active roles alternate; directions in brackets are for [ ravens / larks ] active, respectively. When ravens (on the inside of a line of four) gate the larks (on the outside), the gate should be tight (to avoid swinging into other's space), and short (just a quarter turn). In CC, partner is [ 2nd corner / 1st corner ].</span></em></p>
