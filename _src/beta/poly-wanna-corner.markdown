	      <p><strong>A1</strong>: N balance and swing (end facing down)</p>
	      <p><strong>A2</strong>: down the hall four in line, [ right / left ] side turn as couple/other side turn alone (puts the [ ravens / larks ] (actives) in the middle)</p>
              <p>come back, [ larks / ravens ] (on the outside) gate their neighbor up and around to face across
	      <p><strong>B1</strong>: [ ravens / larks ] turn same role contra-corners</p>
	      <p><strong>B2</strong>: same role balance and swing</p>
              <p><strong>C1</strong>: (roll out of swing for) partner balance and swing</p>
              <p><strong>C2</strong>: [ ravens / larks ] [ RH / LH ] chain across</p>
              <p>[ left / right ] hand star 1x to new N's</p>
      </span>
      <p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: <span class="dance-notes">Active roles alternate; directions in brackets are for [ ravens / larks ] active, respectively. In the transition into CC, one of the actives will have an awkward hand transition -- it's up to the neighbor gating them to pass their right hand into the allemande. In CC, one of your corners is your partner, don't be alarmed. C2 chain is always done by the actives.</span></em></p>
