Time is what turns kittens into cats. No, a bad day is when someone's yellin' spooks the cattle. What, you think this isn't real just because of all the vampires, and demons, and ex-vengeance demons, and the sister that used to be a big ball of universe-destroying energy? Better to cut you down to size, grandma. I am never gonna see a merman, ever. I've seen the best and the worst of you. Anyway, he seemed to be having a kind of man-reaction. Say, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug? Boy, when they were handing out school spirit, you didn't even stand in line, did you? No, Angel, it's not you. <!-- more -->

She is the slayer. You are talking crazy-person talk. Put your words in word places please. I brought you some supper but if you'd prefer a lecture, I've a few very catchy ones prepped: sin and hellfire, one has lepers. The human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates. That probably would've sounded more commanding if I wasn't wearing my yummy sushi pajamas. These endless days are finally ending in a blaze. See if you were really a witch, you'd do a spell to escape. If you can't do something smart, do something right. No, Angel, it's not you. No need, little lady, your tears of gratitude are enough for me.

I don't buckle. Occasionally I swashbuckle. Should I start this program over? A whole mess of sparrows turning on a dime, salmon trucking upstream.

I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons. I, Anya, promise to love you, to cherish you, to honor you, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something? I'm a comfortador also. That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship.
