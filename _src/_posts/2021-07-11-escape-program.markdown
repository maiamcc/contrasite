I'm thrilled beyond belief that I got to go to Pinewoods this summer, and dance, and hug all my friends, swim in Long Pond and eat pot de créme on the porch. Being on the mic again after all this bullshit was such a damn delight (and I even remembered which end to talk into!). So many thanks to the organizers who scrambled on 8 weeks' notice to put together this incredible week. Here's my program:
