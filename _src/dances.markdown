Here are a handful of dances that I've written, with more to come soon! (I've got more on the back-burner, but I only post dances here once they've been tested and vetted.) If any of these dances strike your fancy, _please do call them_, spread them around, etc.! I ask only that (if you feel like it) you [drop me a line](/contact.html) and let me know how it went. Feedback is always welcome, as are requests.

  <p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: Locate your shadow at the start of the dance: look along your side of the set past your partner, shadow will be the first opposite-role person you see. Coming back into the dance at the middle of A1 or the middle of B1, dancers should reenter SWAPPED (i.e., lady on the left, gent on the right). Written in Summer 2015 for Kate Fais on the occasion of her dying her hair pink, and first called January 2016 at the Youth Trad Song Weekend contradance.</em></p>
