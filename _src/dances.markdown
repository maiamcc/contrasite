Here are a handful of dances that I've written, with more to come soon! (I've got more on the back-burner, but I only post dances here once they've been tested and vetted.) If any of these dances strike your fancy, _please do call them_, spread them around, etc.! I ask only that (if you feel like it) you [drop me a line](/contact.html) and let me know how it went. Feedback is always welcome, as are requests.

<!-- TODO: style this better
A note on dance difficulties:

* `accessible`: interesting and enjoyable for experienced dancers, but accessible for beginners, hard to mess up
* `advanced`: a little trickier, better suited to later in the evening or more experienced halls
* `expert`: you should probably only call these to a very experienced hall or at an advanced dance
