Here are some dances of mine that have not been fully vetted/tested, or that I'm still sort of lukewarm about in their current incarnation, but that I still wanted to be able to share with folks. You are more than welcome to call any of these dances, just know that you do so at your own peril. I accept no responsibilty for injury or death that results from calling dances on this webpage.

<div class="dance">
  <h4><em>Holy Ghost</em> by Maia McCormick (improper)</h4>
  <p><strong>A1</strong>: neighbor gypsy</p>
  <p>half hey (ladies by L)</p>
  <p><strong>A2</strong>: neighbor gypsy</p>
  <p>neighbor swing</p>
  <p><strong>B1</strong>: circle L 3/4</p>
  <p>partner swing</p>
  <p><strong>B2</strong>: R/L through across</p>
  <p>circle L 3/4 and pass through</p>
  <p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: Written in mass in Amsterdam, Spring 2013.</em></p>

<div class="dance">
  <h4><em>Staying Awake in Mass</em> by Maia McCormick (becket CCW)</h4>
  <p><strong>A1</strong>: (new) ladies alle. R 1x WHILE gents half-orbit CCW (gents will go behind their partner)</p>
  <p>neighbors alle. L 1 3/4</p>
  <p><strong>A2</strong>: NEXT neighbor box the gnat (no balance) (4)</p>
  <p>pull by in the dir. you came to swing CURRENT neighbor (12)</p>
  <p><strong>B1</strong>: in CURRENT hands-4, ladies chain to partner</p>
  <p>half hey (ladies by R)</p>
  <p><strong>B2</strong>: partner b&s</p>
  <p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: Written in mass in Amsterdam, Spring 2013.</p>
  <p>Most of this one is danced with your CURRENT hands-4, but there is a brief jaunt into the future when you box the gnat with your next neighbor in A2.</p>
  <p>At the beginning of the dance, ladies should look RIGHT for a new lady.</p>
  <p>Teaching note: locate next neighbors (the one you'll box the gnat with) in A1 after the allemande/orbit (look left on the side of the set).</p></em>

<div class="dance">
  <h4><em>Fuming in Mass</em> by Maia McCormick (improper)</h4>
  <p><strong>A1</strong>: neighbor b&s</p>
  <p><strong>A2</strong>: long lines forward, gents draw partner back with them and swing (give and take)</p>
  <p><strong>B1</strong>: long lines forward and back</p>
  <p>R/L through across</p>
  <p><strong>B2</strong>: star L 3/4</p>
  <p>neighbor see-saw 1 1/2 to a new neighbor</p>
  <p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: Because when the priest takes a Christmas service as an opportunity to lament that "the mere wish to preserve traditional marriage has you labeled a bigot," what else can you but write a contradance in your head? Late 2014.</em></p>
