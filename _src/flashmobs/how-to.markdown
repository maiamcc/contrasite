Here are some notes I've written up about my personal approach to planning Contradance Flash Mobs, which may be useful to others planning their own contra flash mobs (or other flash mobs more broadly). I'm by no means an authority on this topic, so feel free to take or leave whatever of this write-up you do/don't find useful. Another note: delegation is great. This list represents the ingredients of a successful flash mob, in my experience, but that doesn't mean you have to do them all yourself---delegating to others were possible will save you many valuable brain cells. Happy flashmobbing!

<h3 class="horizline">Notes on Putting On a Contradance Flash Mob</h3>

<ul id="flashmob-how-to">
   <li class="level-1">
      Date (and rain date)
      <ul>
         <li>
            Send out a survey with a sampling of dates/times to get a general sense of availability
            <ul>
               <li><a href="//doodle.com/">Doodle</a> is great for this, esp. their <a href="//support.doodle.com/customer/en/portal/articles/645364-how-do-i-create-a-yes-no-ifneedbe-poll-">yes/no/if-need-be</a> functionality.</li>
               <li>But honestly, only a subset of people fills out the poll anyway, and many will change their plans to be at the selected date. So do your best to pick a date that works for as many folks as possible, but if you plan it, they will come</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>In picking a time, be aware of sundown; try not to be dancing in the dark, or even dusk, as it makes photos/video harder.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Pick a location
      <ul>
         <li>Should be accessible via mass transit</li>
         <li>Is it legal for you to dance there? Will you get hassled by security?</li>
         <li>Will you conflict with another event, performer, etc.? (Either in your space, or nearby enough to be loud, draw part of the crowd away, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Communicating information
      <ul>
         <li>I’ve been using a Facebook event as the source of truth for flash mob info</li>
         <li>Can also maintain a list of emails of interested parties who don’t have Facebook, and send them updates via email</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Advertising the event
      <ul>
         <li>I’ve generally been using Facebook: post on your own page, ask friends to share it, post in relevant contradance groups</li>
         <li>
            Announce at local dances
            <ul>
               <li>Stress that this is NOT an event for beginners, maybe avoid announcing it at dances that are entirely enthusiastic newbies</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Meeting time and place
      <ul>
         <li>Distinct from dancing time and place–should be able to gather and touch base without ruining the surprise of the dancing</li>
         <li>Send maps/photos to clarify specific meeting place</li>
         <li>Include a mobilization time in your plan</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Band (ideally you get a superfabulous band leader to this part)
      <ul>
         <li>Musicians</li>
         <li>A band leader (hopefully same person as is organizing the band)</li>
         <li>Tunes (three sets: warm-up, contra, waltz)</li>
         <li>If ambitious, rehearsal</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Caller
      <ul>
         <li>
            Either get someone very loud, or get some amplification
            <ul>
               <li>Keep it low-key, don’t tempt the cops. I use a pretty cheap megaphone.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Some potential here for something different: multiple people calling the dance from within the set? Broadcasting calls via internet to people’s headphones?</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Dance (the choreography)
      <ul>
         <li>
            Considerations for choosing the dance:
            <ul>
               <li>Intuitive (so it’s easy to memorize): standard-length phrases, no weird move transitions, etc.</li>
               <li>Lots of together movement (e.g. long lines, waves, ring balances) makes it harder to mess up, and potentially more satisfying for onlookers</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Post in advance so dancers can learn it</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Documenting the event
      <ul>
         <li>Ahead of time, find a photographer, videographer</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Fliers for local dances
      <ul>
         <li>Remind organizers to bring their fliers</li>
         <li>Make a flier of all dances in the area?</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Reminders to dancers
      <ul>
         <li>Consider finding a partner beforehand</li>
         <li>Experienced dancers only (dance will not be taught, hard to hear the caller)</li>
         <li>Don’t wear dance shoes</li>
         <li>Learn the dance beforehand</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Just before the event
      <ul>
         <li>If outside, check the weather and make the call: is it happening or are we falling back to rain date?</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="level-1">
      Afterwards
      <ul>
         <li>Thank the particiants (mention relevant folks by name)</li>
         <li>
            Post photo/video
            <ul>
               <li>Or poke ppl to post photo/video if it’s out of your hands and they’ve been taking a long time</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
