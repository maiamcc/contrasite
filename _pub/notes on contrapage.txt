I SHOULD WRITE UP:
- past programs
- dance philosphy

blog to-do:
  "categories" page that lists all categories? (Currently gross styling, see eg. http://contra.maiamccormick.com/blog/categories/foo/)
  rss feed?
  blog menu should suck less--maybe have a categories dropdown?
  sidebar with recent posts? (look at formatting in partials/sidebar.scss, which currently isn't imported)
  title the "foo" category page
  dividers between blog posts on the blog homepage

i unbroke the archive page but only with hacks, it'd be neat if the actual 'archives' partial loaded (but it can't find header-bg for some reason).
archive colors would be nice, so my entire page isn't the same two colors

eventually replace my "force left" with the existing "force left" etc.
