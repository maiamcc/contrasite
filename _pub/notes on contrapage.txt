calling page should contain:
link to any blogposts about dancing
dance philosophy
past programs
flash mob videos
me calling videos

do i want my blog to have a sidebar?

blog to-do:
  individual posts should show tags
  "categories" page?
  rss feed?
  blog menu should suck less--maybe have a categories dropdown?

i unbroke the archive page but only with hacks, it'd be neat if the actual 'archives' partial loaded (but it can't find header-bg for some reason).
archive colors would be nice, so my entire page isn't the same two colors
using sass variables for colors instead of copying the hex would also be nice
actual formatting on the archives page? i think the partials page has some fancy date stuff

tell the maintainer: doesn't import custom css, maybe should fix that so it works better out of the box?

eventually replace my "force left" with the existing "force left" etc.
