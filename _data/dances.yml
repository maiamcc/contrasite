  #   notes: 'written fall 2015 at The Good Stuff diner, beta tested by CDNY dancers. With the swing>swing transitions, encourage dancers to roll out of one swing and straight into the next. End effects: make sure you\'re waiting out on the correct diagonal (to come in in A1, wait on the left diag., to come in at B2, on the right).'
