  comp_notes: "Written as part of my search for R/L-thru dances that actually flow."
  date_written: 201703
  blurb: "R/L-thru flow out of a square through"
  choreo:
    a1:
      - balance the ring (4) and spin right (4)
      - balance the ring (4)
      - pass through along the set to new neighbors (2) and single-file circle L one place (2)[^1]
    a2:
      - full interrupted square through (starts with right hand to new neighbor across)
    b1:
      - R/L-thru (pull by neighbor across)
      - half hey (robins pass R)
    b2:
      - partner balance and swing
  footnotes:
    1: "In the single-file circle (may also be described as \"promenade the ring\"), larks continue walking forward one place and robins turn left to follow their partner."

- title: My Partner's Partner
  formation: 4x4[^1]
  difficulty: expert
  fave: true
  choreo_notes: "All moves through the robins' chain happen UP AND DOWN, and the remainder of the dance happens ACROSS (prep the dancers on the different between up/down and across orientation)."
  comp_notes: "Written for <a href=\"https://chromamine.com/contra/\" target=\"_blank\">Harris Lapiroff</a> for the American Week 2023 auction. The A2 figure leading into a chain is taken from Tavi Merrill's <a href=\"https://www.ibiblio.org/contradance/thecallersbox/dance.php?id=7631\" target=\"_blank\">Soul Reversal</a>."
  date_written: 202307
  blurb: "4x4 where you swap partners with your trail buddy each time through the dance."
  choreo:
    a1:
      - give and take opposite neighbor to robin's home side
      - this neighbor swing (all moves in A2 are with this N)
    a2:
      - lines of four go forward, on the way back larks roll neighbor away
      - (up and down) larks allemande R 1x (6)
      - pass neighbor by L shoulder (2)
    b1:
      - robins chain to partner up and down, and courtesy turn to face ACROSS[^2]
      - half hey ACROSS (robins pass R) and larks ricochet[^3]
    b2:
      - opposite role trail buddy balance and swing—this is your new partner![^3]
  footnotes:
    1: "Your partner alternates every time through the dance between your original partner and your opposite-role trail buddy. Robins progress diagonally across, larks progress straight across."
    2: "For this courtesy turn, one side turns 1/4 and one side turns 3/4, so it'll feel either longer or shorter than they expect. Encourage dancers to fill the music in a way that makes sense rather than starting the hey early."
    3: We love a surprise, but when the dancers are lining up, please give some warning about the AMOUNT of trail buddy interaction so no one gets locked into a ~partner they don't feel comfortable with. (E.g. "line up for a 4-face-4, and note you'll be swinging your trail buddy a LOT.")

- title: The Baby Jo
  formation: becket R
  difficulty: advanced
  comp_notes: "Written for Baby Jo Byers (a J-hook promenade + a circle spells \"Jo\"!). The title is, of course, a riff on \"The Baby Rose\" by David Kaynor."
  date_written: 202312
  blurb: "Smooth lost-and-found dance with a J-hook promenade + circle right."
  choreo:
    a1:
      - larks allemande L 1.5x
      - neighbor swing
    a2:
      - robins chain to partner (and turn away to face shadow on the side)[^1]
      - shadow allemande R 1.5x (and face across in skater promenade position)[^2]
    b1:
      - "J-hook promenade[^3]: promenade across and loop wide to face new neighbors"
      - with these new neighbors, circle R 1x
    b2:
      - (turn away to find your partner on the side[^4]) partner right shoulder 'round and swing
  footnotes:
    1: >
      For best flow into the shadow allemande, dancers should twirl on the courtesy turn OR do
      an open chain. (If you're going to mention this as a teaching point, please offer the open
      chain as an alternative for those who don't like twirling!)
    2: >
      To get into skater promenade, keep R hands with your shadow (transition to handshake grip),
      take L hands with them as well, and robin turn their torso to face across (this may warrant a quick demo).
    3: Before the J-hook promenade, note the couple on the left diagonal; you will end up in that spot, across from that couple.
    4: I find this transition works best if the lark under-rotates, i.e. never completely turns their back on their partner; rather, at the very end of the circle, walk mostly forward across the set to swing.
  choreo_notes: "END EFFECTS: anyone out after A2 must immediately come back in for the promenade (i.e. either get on the left diag. and promenade across+left, or slide in on the right diagonal). Otherwise, wait out improper."

- title: Celestial Beans
  formation: reverse indecent[^1]
  difficulty: advanced
  comp_notes: "Written for/premiered at Beantown Stomp 2024 (yet another dance developed while napping)."
  date_written: 202403
  blurb: "Flowy facing star dance with surprising progression."
  choreo:
    a1:
      - neighbor inside hand balance and twirl to swap[^2]
      - facing star CW 1x (keep outside hands with N, larks take LH/robins take RH; larks go forward/robins back up)
    a2:
      - neighbor right shoulder 'round and swing
    b1:
      - balance the ring, give and take partner to the lark's side
      - partner swing
    b2:
      - circle left 3/4
      - with partner, zig zag to the FAR SIDE of new neighbors[^3] and turn single[^4] to face them
  footnotes:
    1: As a normal improper dance but with the 1s below the 2s. To get here, start in improper, note everyone's direction of progression, and then swing this neighbor to swap places with them. (Importantly, everyone will still be progressing in the direction that they originally identified—i.e. from here, they'll be progressing to the neighbors BEHIND them.) When out at the ends, wait out improper.
    2: Lark's right hand/robin's left hand; balance and twirl to swap (by default, with the robin going under the joined hands). (I was informed by some squares people that it is technically a mirror star through, but the name of the twirl is IMO unimportant.)
    3: Zig left and zag right to your new neighbors (the dance will restart with them), and continue zigging right/zag left to the far side of that couple. (It's a SINGLE PROGRESSION DANCE, so don't start dancing with new new neighbors in improper.)
    4: I recommend turning towards your partner (for a brief moment of eye contact), as it gives good momentum for everyone's correct hand in A1. Consider teaching this, as dancers have wildly different ideas of how to turn single.
