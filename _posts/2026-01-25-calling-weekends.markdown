Hey congrats, you just got booked for your first weekend (or longer!) gig—it’s a big milestone in your calling journey, and hopefully this is your first weekend of many! It’s also a completely different beast than regular evening dances or even double dances and all day special events. Here are some bits of advice (presented in no particular order) that I’d give as you embark on your first (or second, or twelfth) weekend calling gig.

## Know thine dancers
The composition of every dance weekend is different, and it’s important to know what you’re walking into. Talk to the event organizers, folks who have called that event before, friends who have attended previously, etc.<!-- more -->

#### Questions about your attendees and local dance culture:
* What’s the general skill level of the floor?
* How many people will be there who are new to contra? (And how good are other attendees at guiding newbies?)
* What other styles of dance do the attendees do?[^1]
* Anything else notable about your attendance demographics?[^2]
* What role terms are the attendees accustomed to?
* How many walkthroughs will the attendees expect for the average dance?
* Will attendees be excited or dismissive about non-contra formations and styles? (4x4s, triplets, squares, ECD, barn dance, etc.)
* Anything else esoteric about this community’s dance preferences? (E.g. an especially low tolerance for no-neighbor-swing dances, or similar)
* What dances are over-called in the region you’re headed to?[^3]

#### Questions about the event itself:
* Any event traditions you’ll be expected to honor? (E.g. calling a specific dance as the last contra; starting Saturday evening with a grand march; Money Musk; etc.)
* Are dancers on time to sessions or do they drift late? Are specific sessions particularly well or poorly attended?
* How crowded does the floor get, and how are the lines arranged? Are there particular issues with floor slant or crowding?

## Get your [dance] house in order[^4]
Before you leave, get your dance collection in order. If your box is organized spatially, make sure your cards are back in their homes and not stuffed in weird places from your most recent gig. This is a good time to recopy that tattered old card, or to add in those cool new dances that you collected recently.

Also, you need a lot more dances on hand for a weekend than for a regular evening dance; make sure your collection is big enough to see you through. For reference, at the average Fri-Sun dance weekend, I’ll expect to call 20-30 dances, +/- more for workshops and medleys. I’d want at least double that amount in my collection to account for last minute program changes, not calling things my co-caller has already called, etc. (Of course, if you’re adding any new-to-you dances to your box, study them to make sure that there are no unwelcome surprises when you call them for the first time!)

## Consider the schedule
When planning your sessions, take note of their context in the schedule: what other sessions you’re up against, what time of day it is, where in the course of the event they fall, etc. Specific ways this might shake down:
* At most residential camps, evening dances are the most happenin’ (at least until it starts getting late); plan for your crowdpleasers and big-hall dances
* Your morning session should probably be a bit chiller and less think-y than your afternoon and evening sessions (at least until people’s bodies and brains have warmed up)
* Less crowded sessions (often mornings and afternoons) are good places to put your dances that need a lot of space (poussettes, orbits, rollaways across, etc.); avoid programming these dances in the middle of the evening dance, when the floor is typically the most crowded
* Expect higher attendance in blocks where there aren’t other dance sessions[^5]
* Plan for easier dances in a session opposite a “challenging contras'' block because many of the strongest dancers will be off doing those
* Consider the amount of buffer between your session and other stuff, especially meals. If you’re right after something that you expect might run late (meal, open mic, etc.), be prepared to start late or to have people trickling in as you start

### Beware the Sunday Sleepies
Wherever you’ve calibrated your dance difficulty for the weekend, be prepared to take it down a notch or two on the last day of the event. Everyone will be overdanced and underslept, and brains (including yours!) will be fried. You’ll still want to call fun and interesting stuff, but Sunday is the day to tend towards the crowd pleasers and the bulletproof classics, not the day to pull out your extra special tricky challenge dance. Not that you can’t call tough stuff on Sunday, but it should be a smaller proportion of your program, and you should be prepared to bail if needed.

Notably, _you_ will probably also have the Sunday Sleepies; there’s no shame in erring towards dances that _you_ can call well in that state. Just as Sunday isn’t the time to push the dancers, it’s not the time to push yourself: aim for surefire wins that will leave everyone feeling good.

## What to call and how to call it
### Maybe run it longer
I usually run my dances a little longer at weekends than at regular evening dances! The lines tend to be longer; higher skill level means I spend less time teaching and so can afford longer dances; and weekend-level talent means awesome music, so I want to let the band groove.

At a regular evening dance I call my dances 13-15x; at a weekend, I'll tend towards 15-17x. (But use your judgement! If the lines are short, this advice doesn’t necessarily apply. If dancers are looking bored, consider wrapping up.)

Warning: if your dance length heuristic is “one couple gets all the way down and back,” that’s a dangerous one to use at an event with really long lines; consider counting times through, timing the dance, waiting for your top couple to get down the line and only halfway back, etc.

### Don’t call complex for complex’s sake
Especially if your local dance is more intermediate, you might jump at the chance to call your gnarliest material at a fancy dance weekend. By the same token, you might worry about keeping the fancy weekend dancers interested and calling a complex _enough_ program.

These are super understandable, super common instincts! However, two points of caution:

Firstly, the level of dance is not automatically super high just because it’s a weekend. This goes back to knowing your floor—talk to organizers, past callers, and past attendees to get a sense of the skill level, and make sure you’re not pitching your program harder than it ought to be just because of your assumptions about “weekend skill level.”

Secondly, even if the level of dancing is generally  high, a weekend full of the gnarliest contras imaginable wouldn’t actually be that fun. Resist the urge to program all your funkiest material just because you can, and space it out with more accessible dances so that you don’t fry people’s brains. There’s certainly such a thing as a program that’s too easy, but that’s not the most common failure mode here, and I’d worry more about guarding against the opposite. It can be intimidating to feel like you need to keep a bunch of hotshot dancers interested, but I promise that they’ll have fun even if you’re not calling the hardest possible dances at any given moment. And don’t underestimate the satisfaction of a moderate-difficulty dance done well, with a floor full of great dancers! Optimize for flow and satisfaction rather than for complexity for its own sake.

### No-walkthroughs
No-walk dances or mini-medleys can be your friend at a relatively experienced dance weekend, as they’re a fun novelty and a bit of a different challenge than a straight up Hard Contra™. A no-walk often hits the sweet spot of being stimulating but not _too_ hard. Plus, they’re great for rounding out that last awkward bit of time in a session.

### How much to program?

How much programming should you do in advance? My very helpful answer is: “some, but not too much.” Even more annoyingly, the values of “some” and “too much” vary from person to person, but hear me out: you don’t want to be scrambling to program just before every session, but you don’t want to walk in with your program set in stone and ignore the vibes of the event.

My approach is often to pre-program my very first slot of the weekend (with plenty of alternates and fallback dances), and then wait to get a sense of the group before programming anything else. Another good approach is to pull a handful of dances that you’re particularly excited about calling, and then try to work them into your programs throughout the event; this gives you a little structure but maintains your flexibility.

If you’ve got a co-caller, coordinate with them. Everyone’s caller collaboration methods are different, so talk about what works best for both of you. At minimum, you should have a way to communicate to each other what you’ve already called so that you don’t repeat each other’s dances. (Often, just a piece of paper in the main dance hall where you write down dance titles is sufficient.)

## Take care of yourself
A dance weekend, especially a residential one, is a whirlwind that often involves staying up too late, waking up too early, and pushing your body to its limits. Pace yourself: you’ve got a responsibility to be relatively with it and vertical come Sunday afternoon.

This doesn’t mean that you’re not allowed to have fun, but consider being more conservative with physical and mental energy than you would if you were just there as a dancer. Maybe skip that late-night afterparty, decline that third drink, or take some extra time out of the afternoon dance to eat or nap. Also, importantly, conserving your energy starts _at the beginning of the event_ (or even before!), not a night or two in when you’re already feeling the effects of pushing yourself.

In particular, make sure to eat well; your body and your brain need fuel for calling! Now is not the time to skip meals or subsist only on granola bars. (I always make sure I’ve got filling and energy-giving snacks on hand if I need a boost while calling.) And remember, naps are your friend!

Dancers need to care for their bodies all weekend, but as a caller, you’ve got an additional thing to maintain: your voice! Getting enough sleep is huge here. Also watch out for raucous singing sessions, long and hushed late night conversations, etc., as these are great ways to shred your voice. Stay hydrated, drink tea if you need to, and make sure you’re using good mic technique and not shouting. At the first sign of vocal irritation, buckle down and save your voice, because it’s your most essential bit of caller technology! (See my vocal health blog post for way more vocal health tips than you ever wanted.)

### Staff Privilege
You’ve got a ton on your plate when you’re on staff, so make your life easier and invoke your staff privilege! If you need to eat a really quick lunch so you can go program your afternoon session, ask politely to skip the line! Don’t be shy, make that slightly esoteric housing request! The organizers and the campers want you to be comfortable and on your game–they will help you!

Also, this may be a weird thing to say, but if you’re someone used to being social glue in your contra community: I officially absolve you of that responsibility at camp! Like, don’t be a jerk to people, but you have a literal job to do, and don’t need to be putting in tons of work on top of that to make folks feel welcome. There’s a balance to this, I think—definitely be a friendly face and chat amiably, but if you’re the type to assign yourself as a buddy to a dancer who’s new to camp, or to be the one that your friends lean on in times of stress, remember that you’re allowed to gently say no to those things if you’re feeling overtaxed. Folks will understand!

## In Conclusion
Hey, congrats on your gig! First big events can be freaky, but the organizers and the attendees want you to succeed—so go out there and knock ‘em dead![^6]

[^1]:  This might be relevant if, for instance, you’re going to borrow figures from ECD; will you need to teach your Dolphin Hey entirely from scratch, or will ⅔ of the floor already know it?

[^2]: As an example, I once called a weekend where many attendees were older folks who were generally competent dancers, but moved slowly. This told me that I could program fairly complex things, as long as they were low piece count and as long as one slow dancer doesn’t gum up the whole line. (Specifically, I skipped full square throughs and chain-the-line dances (3-33-33 et al.) in favor of some novel (but not fast!) transitions or interesting shadow interactions.)

[^3]: This is probably one for other callers; very few non-callers are the right type of nerd to know lots of dance sequences by name!

[^4]: You know, your dance house. Uh, where your dances live.

[^5]: Of course, this depends wildly on the camp and your attendees! Maybe this camp’s nature walk is a beloved tradition and even though you’re opposite “just a nature walk,” you’ll still get relatively low attendance. Or maybe there’s no other dance session opposite you because it’s the time of day that most people go nap. Make your best guesses, but stay flexible.

[^6]: Uh, not literally. I didn’t think I would have to include this in a blog post but please don’t do murder and _definitely_ don’t then tell people “it’s okay, Maia McCormick told me to do murder.
