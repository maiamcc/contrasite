I would say I'm alllmost recovered from the all-nighter I pulled this weekend calling the graveyard shift (4AM--7AM)---but heck, what a blast! Here's the program I called (most of these walked through minimally or not at all):

If you should find yourself calling the stupid-o'clock slot at Dawn Dance (or elsewhere), here's some of the stuff that I did that I found super useful (with thanks to past late-night callers Luke Donforth and Alex Deis-Lauby for their advice):

+ **Prepare your program** - 4AM is no time to be programming on the fly.
+ **Keep it simple, stupid** - dancers are fried at this point in the night, so don't throw anything too complicated at them. At an event like Dawn Dance, the dancers are _advanced_, and can handle complex/uncommon figures like contracorners, orbits, left-hand chains, etc., but don't have the brain-power to process anything unexpected. Strive for idiomatic dances with good flow---this is not the time for "this one weird trick" dances, or figures that run counter to muscle memory. The more one move flows into the next, the better; remembering "I'm a raven, and now I have to do that thing" from a standstill is hard at stupid-o'clock.
+ **No seriously, keep it simple** - simple dances done well by a hall of experienced dancers are _so satisfying_. I'm not saying you have to call Butter and Baby Rose and Fredrick Contra all night long, but you don't need to get super complex and fancy for people to have a good time. Again, you're looking for solid, satisfying, idiomatic dances.
+ **No-walkthroughs are your friend** - the less time your dancers have to stand around, the less time they have to realize how sleepy they are. No-walkthrough dances keep everyone moving and awake(ish). Bonus: a program of largely no-walkthrough dances constrains the complexity of dances you can call (see above points), which is great for someone like me who tends towards harder dances.
+ **Take a damn nap, eat some damn food** - be good to your feeble flesh vessel, as you will need its cooperation to make it through Dawn Dance. Take a nap if you can (in your car, in a sleeping bag on the lawn)---even 30--90 mins. can make a difference. Keep hydrated and fed; it usually doesn't occur to people to eat _meals_ during an all-nighter, but it can work wonders (I had a sandwich at 2AM). Bring snacks to fortify yourself during your calling slot.
+ **Plan for sunrise** - lights-off time at Dawn Dance varies due to weather etc., but at this particular dance, we turned the lights off around 6:15 (note that sunrise comes earlier on Memorial Day). The lights-off dance should start relaxed and middle-of-the-road, and leave room for the band to crank it up when the lights go off; have a dance prepared that can be both relaxedly satisfying and drivingly hardcore.
+ **Get yourself a damn amazing band** - okay, you probably have less say in this one, but y'all, [The Organic Family Band](https://www.facebook.com/theorganicfamilyband/) is _amazing_ and it was such a treat to work with them. (Seriously though, the bands that play Dawn Dance are top notch, and they do most of the hard work of keeping the dancers awake; acknowledge and thank them, and your sound person, profusely.)
+ **Always more puns** - this one is pretty self-explanatory. Because if 5AM of an all-nighter isn't the best time for stupid puns, I don't know what is!

Anyone else got tips for surviving late-night calling slots? Share them in the comments!
